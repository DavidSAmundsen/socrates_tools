IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to generate spectral files using the CKD water
vapor continuum the source file the SOCRATES source file
src/correlated_k/caviar_continuum_v1_0.f90
should be replaced by
src/correlated_k/ckd_continuum_v2_4.f90

The code then need to be re-compiled before running the scripts in
this folder.
